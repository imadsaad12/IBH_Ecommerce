How we are going to merge changes done on you branch to master branch:
1. Create branch with name with the following convention :  TASK-<NUMBER>/<TASK-TITLE> , ex: TASK-132/add-search-bar-component
2. Create PR (check PR topic) with the following description :
    a. what was done
    b. link to BackEnd PR if exist
    c. how to test
    d. Add team members in Reviewers section
3. Any one of the team could pick the PR and review it (unless you want specific member to review it)
4. Reviewer will pull the branch, test it, put comments if something is not working as mentioned in PR and finally will either request changes or approve,
   if PR approved will merge it else will address comments then ask for another review
